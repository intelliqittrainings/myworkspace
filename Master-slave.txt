MAster Slave Architecture of Jenkins
============================================
This is used distribute the work load to additional linux
servers called as slaves.This is used when we want to run multiple 
jobs on jenkins parallelly.

Setup
============
1 Create a new AWS ubuntu20 instance

2 Install the same version of java as present in the master
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk

3 Setup passwordless SSH betwen Master and slave
  a) Connect to slave and set password to default user
     sudo passwd ubuntu
  b) Edit the ssh config file
     sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     Search for "PasswordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
  c) Restart ssh
     sudo service ssh restart
  d) Connect to Master using git bash
  e) Generate the ssh keys
     ssh-keygen
  f) Copy the ssh keys
     ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private_ip_of_slave
     This will copy the content of the public keys to a file called
     "authorised_keys" on the slave machine






ssh ubuntu@172.31.25.7  java -jar slave.jar
